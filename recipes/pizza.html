                Layer noodles, cheeses, and sauce in a oven safe pan until
                you experience a pan overflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue doing this until you reach the stack pointer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upon reaching the stack pointer, add a sticky note that says
                "RETURN COOKED LASAGNA" to the top of the lasagna.
            </li>
            <li>
                If all has gone well, you will have cooked lasagna on your table,
                otherwise, evacuate a 1 mile radius around the lasagna immediately.
